title: My personal summary of Stanford CS106L
---

This is [CS106L](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106l/index.html), an in-depth modern C++ language course from Stanford. I enrolled in it at the beginning of April and almost finished it today.

This class is amazing. It covers so many interesting and exciting features of modern C++ that I do not get a chance to learn in my school C++ class, including initialization lists, STL containers and algorithms, lambda expressions, templates, all the six SMFs, move semantics, r-value reference, cpp-style casting (static_cast/const_cast), smart pointers, RAII, etc. These make the code modern and robust! These are the real C++ things!

I learnt this course from the website. This is actually not an open source course. I can't find the lecture videos and notes. What I am able to read are only the slides. Every week there are two lectures on Tuesday and Thursday. The slides are updated on the website the next day and I download them to my tab. They are not very clear so what I have learnt is really superficial. There are two assignments, I tried to finish the second locally, but the online submission system is only open to Stanford students, so... I don't really know what level I'm at. But, on the plus side, at least I am learning the direction I should go.

If you also want to learn more about modern C++, give this course a try.
